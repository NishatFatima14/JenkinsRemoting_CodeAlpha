# JenkinsRemoting_CodeAlpha
This project demonstrates Jenkins Remoting by setting up a controller and remote nodes via Docker. It securely distributes build loads across multiple machines, runs jobs on different OS/architectures, improves security through node isolation, and provides hands-on experience with Jenkins remote execution.
